- improve `useRoomTopic` to use ws payload, instead of just invalidating room query
- unit tests wherever possible
- show opponent's name or nickname (to be created)
- maybe fixed, to check on prod:
  - unexpected logged out, then even homepage was prompting a login
  - Sometimes on refresh I see the login page for a moment
